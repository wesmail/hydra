For monitoring the following files should be copied.

The source code for monitoring GUI:  
mdcgui.h
mdcgui.cc 
histdraw.h
histdraw.cc
Makefile

For ROOT CINT:
LinkDef.h

and rootlogon.C 
for starting of the Root session.

Please, don't forget to update hmdcmonitor.h and hmdcmonitor.cc files in 
the $(HADDIR)/mdc directory.

As an example the following macros can be used:

mdcMon.C     - for remote connect to DAQ server
mdcMonHld.C  - for reading from .hld files

To make use:

make all

To run start 2 Root sessions:

In the first one do : analyze("mdcMonHld.C",1000);
The second one will start the Mdc monitor GUI automatically.
