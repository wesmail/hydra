This directory contains the following files:

1. README (this file)
2. projectProgram.cc
3. Makefile

The projection of the HPidTrackCand/HPidTrackCandSim to the ntuple is done by the 
code implemented in the projectProgram.cc file. 
In the output ntuple you can find several variables copied from HPidHitData and HPidTrackData
for three different momentum algorithms KICK/SPLINE/RUNGEKUTTA denoted by small _k, _s and _r. 
In the  projectProgram.cc you can find the desciption of the ntuple variables.

The Makefile file is to make  projectProgram executable. In order to compile the program the HYDRA and ROOT 
enviroment must be set.

Quick Start:
1. Set ROOT and HYDRA enviroment
1. Edit projectProgram.cc and set "user settings" by selecting "simulation" or "real" events
2. Make projectProgram executable
   make
3. Got to build/ directory 
   cd build/
4. Run projectProgram to print help 
   ./projectProgram -h  
5. Run projectProgram (examples):

   ./projectProgram -i inputFile.root -o outputFile.root 
   or
   ./projectProgram -i inputFiles.txt -o outputFile.root -e events
   
Remark:

Check whether the input file contains HPidTrackCand or HPidTrackCandSim.
