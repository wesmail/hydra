 Things To Do
--------------

All: (priority high)
Change PidParticle dependence to PidTrackCand
This destroys the never-used probabilities
Note: If indexes of PidParticle and PidTrackCand are different, old files have to be reprocessed!!!
* mostly done, testing needed

Lambda analysis: (priority low)
Change from PidParticle to PidTrackCand breaks reconstruktion of vertex.
As nobody uses this task this has not been fixed yet.

All (mainly filler): (priority medium)
Add "missing particle" to hyplist.
support for List longer then number of particles needed.
definition of empty and missing particle needs to be fixed.
helper function needed (number of real tracks, get missing particle, ....)
ALL algos need to be checked and evtl changed to support new number of tracks!!!
Missing part in Hyplist needs modifications to SetMomentum as then a HypKine container is needed.
Needs modifications to SetMomentum as then a HypKine container is needed.

All, esp. new Filler and kinematic fit: (prio medium)
Change all GeV varaibles to MeV.

hhypreconstructor: (priority low)
check init/reinit/finalize return values of algos and return values accordingly

hhypcorrecteloss: (priority very low)
ntuple content is fixed to 4 particles, p,p,e+,e-,pi+,pi-
should be changed to variable particles

hhypreconstructor: (priority low)
check init/reinit/finalize return values of algos and return values accordingly
