This directory contains the following files:

1. projectPidHisto.h
2. projectPidHisto.cc
3. anaProjectPidHisto.cc
4. Makefile

The projection of the  ntuple to histograms is done by the 
root based class (MakeClass()) which implementation is in projectPidHisto.h and projectPidHisto.cc files. 
The list of histograms with description can be found in projectPidHisto.h while the condtions under which 
they are filled can be found in projectPidHisto::Loop() function (projectPidHisto.cc).

The anaProjectPidNtuple.cc file conatins main() functions to run the projectPidHisto class. 

The Makefile to make anaProjectPidHisto executable.

Quick Start:
1. Set ROOT and HYDRA enviroment
2. Make anaProjectPidHisto executable
   make
3. Run anaProjectPidHisto
   ./anaProjectPidHisto [inFileName] [outFileName] [nEvents] 
   or
   ./anaProjectPidNtuple [inFileName] [outFileName] 

Example: 
inFileName ==> /d/hades/c2c_dst.root 
outFileName ==> /d/hades/c2c_dst_nt.root
nEvents ==> 1000
