This directory contains the following files:

1. hydraIncludes.h
2. projectPidNtuple.h
3. projectPidNtuple.cc
4. anaProjectPidNtuple.cc
5. Makefile

The hydraIncludes.h contains all hydra includes needed to compile the program.

The projection of the HPidTrackCand/HPidTrackCandSim to the ntuple is done by the 
reconstructor class which implementation is in projectPidNtuple.h and projectPidNtuple.cc files. 
In the output ntuple you can also find several variables copied from HPidHitData and HPidTrackData
for three different momentum algorithms KICK/SPLINE/RUNGEKUTTA denoted by small _k, _s and _r. 
In the HPidHistograms::execute() function (projectPidNtuple.cc) you can find the desciption of the 
ntuple variables.

The anaProjectPidNtuple.cc file conatins main() and anaProjectPidNtuple() functions to run the projectPidNtuple reconstructor within HYDRA enviroment. 

The Makefile to make anaProjectPidNtuple executable.

Quick Start:
1. Set ROOT and HYDRA enviroment
2. Edit anaProjectPidNtuple.cc and change context to "simulation" or "real" depending on the input.
3. Make anaProjectPidNtuple executable
   make
4. Run anaProjectPidNtuple
   ./anaProjectPidNtuple [inFileName] [outFileName] [nEvents] [startEvt]
   or
   ./anaProjectPidNtuple [inFileName] [outFileName] [nEvents]
   or 
   ./anaProjectPidNtuple [inFileName] [outFileName]

Example: 
inFileName ==> /d/hades/c2c_dst.root 
outFileName ==> /d/hades/c2c_dst_nt.root
nEvents ==> 1000
startEvt ==> 0

Remark:

Check if the inFileName the HPidTrackCand or HPidTrackCandSim is stored
