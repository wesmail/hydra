As readPairs and readPairsE have most of their code in common, it seems
reasonable to have only the source files
- readPairs.cc
- pairs.cc
- pairs.h
(as well as one Makefile) left over.  So changes are consistent to
both.  The decision whether code is compiled only in simulation (or
only for experimental data) is done by conditional compilation looking
at the precompiler define "SIMULATION", so if code should be available
only in the simulation, is has to be enclosed in

#if SIMULATION
...
#endif // SIMULATION

as well as code that is only necessary for real data should be enclosed
in

#if ! SIMULATION

#endif // ! SIMULATION

that's why the source files
- readPairsE.cc
- pairsE.cc
- pairsE.h
- pairsS.cc
- pairsS.h
and
- Makefile.exp

have vanished.

Best regards

I have introduced additional precompiler defines to distinguish between 
different ntuple format versions. Therefore different executables are 
created with code versions in the name to indicate which ntuple formats
can be read.
