            The HADES Acceptance Filter for Theorists  (HAFT)
            =================================================

The fiter consists of acceptance matrices, one per particle type, e.g.
e-, e+, pi-, pi+, protons, etc., and of smearing functions that model the
finite detector resolution.

The HADES acceptance matrices are produced and stored as ROOT TH3F objects,
i.e. 3-dimensional histograms Acc(p,theta,phi).  However,  as most theorists
prefer (!) to code their transport theories in FORTRAN, the easiest way to
provide the filter to them is to code it in ANSI FORTRAN 77 as well.  This
means, among other things, that it is best to transform the acceptance matrices
into a FORTRAN-readable format: ascii or binary.  I opted for the more compact,
loss-less and temper-proof binary format.


The Root C++ macro writeHAFT.C is used to do the conversion and writing.

The FORTRAN program readHAFT.f illustrates how the files can be opened and
read.
